--/    SUMMARY    --


There is a default account used by the IIS for anonymous access. This
account has the name "IUSR_COMPUTERNAME" and can be locked out. If
this account is locked off, noone has anonymous access, every request
will be denied. Any IIS using this account and can be made ti prompt
for authentication is vulnerable. So, a website can easiely be
shutdown remote. It is a policy.


--/   REPRODUCE   --


Server Setup:
 - Configure a machine with Windows2000 Server and the name "ATTACKED"
 - Configure a static IP address (for this example 192.168.0.1)
 - Install IIS and configure it to host a web site (use default
   settings)
 - Ensure the account IIS uses for anonymous access is left at the
   default IUSR_EXAMPLENAME
 - Configure the machines Account Lockout Policy as follows:
   Account lockout duration: 0
   Account lockout threshold: 3
   Reset account lockout counter after: 60 minutes

Client Setup:
 - Configure a machine with Windows2000 Professional (for simplicity
   place it on same network segment as the server with an IP of
   192.168.0.2)
 - Make a new local account named unique username
 - Log off and then back on as this new user
 - Go to start > run and type "\\192.168.0.1\admin$" without quotes
 - When prompted for a Username/password use: IUSR_ATTACKED for the
   username and for the password type "nopassword" (or anything equally
   absurd)
 - Repeat the last 2 steps 4 times
 - Open IE and in the address bar type: http://192.168.0.1
 - You will receive an error page telling you access has been denied
