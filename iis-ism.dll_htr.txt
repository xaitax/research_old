Release Date       : 10. November 2001
Application        : M$ IIS 4.0+5.0
Impact             : Reading out some datas.

--/    SUMMARY    --


If you are requesting a filname from a running IIS 4.0 or 5.0 with the
appendage of '+' and then following the extension '.htr' the webserver 
will call ISM.DLL to deal this request. If the '+' exists in the 
filename the ISM.DLL truncates the '+.htr' extension and will open the 
requested file.
If the requested file is not a '.htr' file, a part of the file source code 
will be shown to the attacker.
Maybe the requested file contains some really sensitive informations
like usernames ans passwords.
But the files you want to read out must have read and execute attributes.
The Bug was tested with IIS => 4 ant worked fine.

The URL below should be put into your browser. Wait for the output of 
the browser and have a nice look at the source code you get.

--     PATCH     /--


If the HTR funcion isn´t neccessary for you, remove HTR Script mapping
else wait for a patch M$ will release soon.

The Service Pack 2 [2K] fixes the bug, too. 


--/   LAST WORD   --


There were some ISM.DLL Bugs earlier. But M$ won´t ever solve the problem
to fix all bugs, so this one was released now.
